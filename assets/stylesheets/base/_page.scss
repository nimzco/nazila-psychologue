/**
 * High-, page-level styling.
 *
 * 1. Set the default `font-size` and `line-height` for the entire project,
 *    sourced from our default variables. The `font-size` is calculated to exist
 *    in ems, the `line-height` is calculated to exist unitlessly.
 * 2. Force scrollbars to always be visible to prevent awkward ‘jumps’ when
 *    navigating between pages that do/do not have enough content to produce
 *    scrollbars naturally.
 * 3. Ensure the page always fills at least the entire height of the viewport.
 * 4. Prevent certain mobile browsers from automatically zooming fonts.
 * 5. Fonts on OSX will look more consistent with other systems that do not
 *    render text using sub-pixel anti-aliasing.
